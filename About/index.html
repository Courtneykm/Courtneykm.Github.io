    <p> My name is Courtney Makua. I am a senior in high school and I am 17 years old. I was born on March 26 which makes me an Aries. I was born in Hawaii and raised living in Pearl City until I found myself in Ewa beach. I have a small family consisting of my mom, dad, and cat. I also have a boyfriend of 2 and a half years. </p>


<p> I have a very shy personality, and am generally an introvert since I feel most energized when I am alone. Once you get to know me Iâ€™m a lot more open and exciting. I am a little awkward with average humor that may or may not make you laugh. </p>

<p> One of my main hobbies is I like to play video games. I play on my ps4 pretty much everyday and I started gaming when I was around second grade. At around third grade I had gotten my own ps3 and this is where the addiction started. Check out my <a href="/Profile/index.html">fun</a></li> page for more! </p>

<p> I also enjoy going to the beach with my family on weekends. We usually like to go to Ala Moana beach. </p>
