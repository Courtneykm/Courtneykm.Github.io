    <h1> About me</h1>

    <p> My name is Courtney Makua. I am a senior in high school and I am 17 years old. I was born in March 26 which makes me an Aries. I was born in Hawaii and raised living in numerous areas on Oahu until I found myself in Ewa beach.

I have a very shy personality, and am generally an introvert since I feel most energized when I am alone. Once you get to know me Iâ€™m a lot more open and exciting. I am a little awkward with average humor that may or may not make you laugh. 

One of my main hobbies is I like to play video games. I play on my ps4 pretty much everyday and I started gaming when I was around second grade. At around third grade I had gotten my own ps3 and this is where the addiction started. Check out my fun page for more! </p>
